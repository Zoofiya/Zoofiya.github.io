## Comments and Open graph
#### How did you implement comments to blog posts?
I chose to use Disqus and to create comment boxes I needed to do as following(there):
1. First and foremost, I had to sign up for a Disqus account. It's within your account all of the comments are being sent and managed by me. I could switch from one site to another that I have registered in my account. I then followed the guide on their site and selected jekyll as my platform.  
2. The installing process to jekyll is the next step. In my blog posts' front matters I had to add the key comments and set the value to true as following: 

{% highlight python %}
---
layout: default
comments: true
# other options
---
{% endhighlight %}

3. 
4. 
5.
