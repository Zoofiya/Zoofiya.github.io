## Pre-compiling CSS?

#### What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
I personally enjoyed It. It is clean and structured. I like that I work in different files with different kind of styles for the site, for example structure-styles in my base sass-file, and layout in my layout sass-file. And still they are packed to ony one CSS-file. That is cool.

#### Compare to regular CSS Which techniques did you use? Pros and cons?
There are something called variables that I've been using that is different from CSS. With It I could store resusable values to prevent repetition and excessive code-rows which happened a lot in my previous course. In my prevoius project when I probably repeated a lot in my CSS-file. In the same variable I could store a lot of information as a pack, which is also great. I haven't found any disadvantages with this yet.

It has always bothered me that we could not do nesting in CSS. With Sass I was able to do nesting and skip reference to the same tags over and over.

I also got to try some mixins. Although It was similarly set up and used like the variables, I think It took me more time to understand It. I had to combine the way of thinking in functions with my knowledge of CSS usage. Thereafter, It became somewhat more enjoyable.
