## Pre-compiling CSS?

#### What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
I personally enjoyed It. It is clean and structured. I like that I work in different files with different kind of styles for the site, for example structure-styles in my base sass-file, and layout in my layout sass-file. And still they are packed to ony one CSS-file. That is cool.

#### Compare to regular CSS Which techniques did you use? Pros and cons?
There are something called variables that I've been using that is different from CSS. With It I could store resusable values to prevent repetition and excessive code-rows which happened a lot in my previous course. In my prevoius project when I probably repeated a lot in my CSS-file.
